      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/static/images/notes/sarabhai_crater.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sarabhai Crater&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aristocrat. That is how I will describe Vikram Sarabhai. And, I do not refer to his privilege but rather his behaviour and actions. What has been most inspiring about him is how he was serious (not solemn! he was princely and munificent) and rather exemplary in his conduct – (no, I didn&amp;rsquo;t ChatGPT this, I swear, ignore the em dash) high-integrity and honest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I talk as if I knew him personally. I don&amp;rsquo;t (didn&amp;rsquo;t?). I just finished reading &lt;em&gt;Vikram Sarabhai - A life by Amrita Shah&lt;/em&gt;. I will not attempt a poor reconstruction of his life story here (especially when Amrita has done such a good job) but recommend you check out her work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
