Aristocrat. That is how I will describe Vikram Sarabhai. And, I do not refer to his privilege but rather his behaviour and actions. What has been most inspiring about him is how he was serious (not solemn! he was princely and munificent) and rather exemplary in his conduct – (no, I didn't ChatGPT this, I swear, ignore the em dash) high-integrity and honest.

I talk as if I knew him personally. I don't (didn't?). I just finished reading *Vikram Sarabhai - A life by Amrita Shah*. I will not attempt a poor reconstruction of his life story here (especially when Amrita has done such a good job) but recommend you check out her work.

Man of science, institution builder, munificent, honest, open-minded, rich-yet-rooted. How many people can you say this about?

Something that really gets to me about him is how he put his privilege to a good use, helping shape a newly-independent nation at a critical time. He was associated with many big-name institutes including ISRO and IIM-A and played a key-man-esque role in many of them (as I understand it, I'm not a historian dude).

I cannot tell if I am romanticising him but he comes off as someone who was serious (I know, I'm a broken tape about this) and almost had a higher calling. His conduct really comes off as regal. Composed, willing to help, open-minded, hard-working, well-educated (and lavish). All qualities I appreciate. Perhaps that is why he speaks so much to me. :)

Oh, also, as someone from Ahmedabad, the references to different parts of the city, which I know personally was quite fun. History but near roads you walk by.
