<!-- [i like making computers do my bidding.] -->

I like [computers]((/images/i-love-computers-it.gif)), good stories and science.

I'm currently **looking for work** that lets me dive into these worlds.

When not working on these, I usually spend my time reading, running, watching sports or movies.


## **Now** _(Jan '26)_
- Currently, I am working on a service that abstracts away the logic of locks and provides a simple interface for distributed locking. More soon!

  - Vikram Sarabhai: A Life by Amrita Shah
  - The Martian by Andy Weir
  - The Chola Tigers by Amish Tripathi
